Stocks Soccer is a project based on the mechanics of fantasy games that combines soccer and investments. The main goal of the player (manager) is to assemble a team of players, taking into account their value and projections. Players then need to make transfers at certain times by exchanging players. The one with the most expensive team will be declared the winner. ⚽️💰

🏆🤩 The most important aspect is that this mechanic increases audience engagement in real matches and games. This method can also be used in other industries such as media and entertainment, the financial industry, manufacturing, and others. This is because this mechanic immerses the user inside the industry, allowing them to explore its representatives, its products, stay in constant contact with the industry to track events, and more.

Let's look at the funnel using Stocks Soccer as an example:

1. User registers in the game
2. User studies the players
3. User assembles a team
4. User monitors events in the world of soccer
5. User makes smart transfers
6. User receives a prize and increases their interest
7. User sees that a club will play in his city, where a player he owns contributed to his victory
8. User buys a ticket and goes to the stadium, becoming a true fan

** The mechanic is simple, but the competitive element makes it even more interesting and exciting! 😉⚽️🎮 **
