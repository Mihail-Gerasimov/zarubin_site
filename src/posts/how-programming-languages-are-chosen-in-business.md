In the world of development, there are many programming languages, and their number is constantly growing. For the web, some use more reliable and time-tested languages like Java, C#, and PHP. Modern developers are already experimenting with Go and even Flutter for web development. Mobile development has its own set of languages. The choice of a specific language depends on the nature of the task and the preferences of the developer. How do you determine which technology stack to choose?

I have developed the following methodology, consisting of several questions:

- What is the expected load in terms of users: up to 10k users, up to 100k, or more?
- What type of project is it: a startup or a development project?
- How many modules are in the system: up to 5, up to 15, or more?
- What IT competencies are developed within the company?
- What stack are other IT projects in the company built on?

These questions help determine the architecture, infrastructure, strategy, and, consequently, the technology stack.

Once, I conducted an audit of an IT system written in C# ASP.NET. There were no developers on this stack in the staff, and moreover, there were no more than 10 job openings for this stack in the entire city at that time, indicating a lack of demand. Questions about supporting such a project caused quiet bewilderment. We had to compress the C# portion into a separate module, outsource its support, and build the main stack on a technology that could be maintained internally within the company.

This approach ensures that the chosen technology stack aligns with both the project's requirements and the company's capabilities, facilitating smoother development and support processes.
