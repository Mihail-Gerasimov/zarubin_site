## About

Jedipay is a payment processing platform designed to facilitate instant, secure transactions across various services and vendors. The system includes a merchant-facing dashboard, API integration modules, and a consumer wallet interface. The goal was to create a flexible infrastructure similar to Robokassa, tailored for modern digital ecosystems.

## Problem

The client aimed to build an independent payment gateway but lacked a clear product structure, flow, and tech architecture. They needed support in defining the system from scratch — from UX logic to technical documentation and implementation roadmap.

## Scope of Work

<p><strong>Merchant Dashboard</strong> was designed to provide business clients with a unified interface to:</p>

- manage invoices and incoming payments,
- generate and track payment links or QR codes,
- set up and configure API keys for integration with their platforms,
- view transaction logs, statuses, and reconciliation reports,
- manage account settings, KYC data, and withdrawal methods.

<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Payment Gateway API</strong> allows integration with online stores, platforms, and third-party services. Features include:</p>

<br>

- tokenized card payments,
- recurring billing,
- webhook notification support,
- customizable checkout widgets,
- fraud detection and transaction scoring.

<br>
<br>

<p><strong>User Wallet Interface</strong> (optional module) enables end users to:</p>

<br>

- link cards or bank accounts,
- store balance or loyalty points,
- pay via mobile number, QR code, or in-app tokens,
- view transaction history and manage settings.

<br>
<br>

<p>Jedipay was built with a modular architecture, supporting scalable microservices, secure data encryption, and real-time processing to ensure compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS.</p>
