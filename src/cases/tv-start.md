## About

The goal of the project was to create a unified digital ecosystem for broadcasting sports events online. The platform consists of a mobile application, a Smart TV application, and a web-based portal. The system is designed to support both live streaming and on-demand content access, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across devices.

## Problem

The client had a strong brand and vision but lacked the technical expertise to design a cross-platform broadcasting solution. They needed a team that could build a flexible, scalable product to reach a diverse audience of sports fans across mobile, TV, and web.

## Scope of Work

<p><strong>Web platform</strong> serves as the central hub for content management, user access, event scheduling, and analytics. Admins can upload broadcasts, monitor stream performance, manage paywall settings, and generate performance reports.</p> <p>The <strong>Smart TV application</strong> is optimized for large-screen viewing and remote control interaction. It allows users to:</p>

- browse upcoming sports events,
- watch live streams or replays,
- subscribe to premium packages,
- access multi-language commentary and statistics.

<br>
<br>

<p>The <strong>mobile application</strong> is tailored for users on the go. It provides:</p>

<br>

- personalized notifications about upcoming matches and streaming availability,
- live chat and fan interaction during matches,
- payment system integration for subscriptions and one-time events,
- user account and watch history sync across platforms.

<br>
<br>

<p>The platform architecture ensures scalability, low-latency streaming, and a smooth user experience, regardless of the device used.</p>
